# To-Do
- Put all syntax into a single class of constants, including operators.
- Create class for calling error messages (as constants?).
- Try and create individual class for each piece of compiler feature functionality (e.g. class for boolean handling, etc).
- Create custom input object.
- Rename "term" to "operand"?
- Put error messages into their corresponding classes (e.g. lexical error messages go in the class LexicalError). Store the strings as constants, and return through static methods?
- Try and see if recursion can be implemented in the Lexer.
