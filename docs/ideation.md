## Inspiring Work
### Compiler Inspiration
*Pinecone, William W Wold*  
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-programming-language-pipeline-91d3f449c919/  
Over the course of a few months, they created a working programming language called Pinecone. At the beginning of the project, the developer has no experience in the field and learned as he went along. This work is relevant as it proves that such an undertaking can be done successfully with little or no prior experience, whilst also detailing the necessary steps a beginner must consider.

### More Compiler Inspiration
*The Super Tiny Compiler, Jamie Kyle*  
https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler  
An ultra-simplified compiler written in JavaScript, containing all of the major pieces of a modern compiler. This work is relevant as it acts as a basic example of what I want to achieve, and will provide valuable insight into the inner workings of a compiler that I can review during development.

### Turing Machine Inspiration
*Turing Machine Simulator, Martin Ugarte*  
https://turingmachinesimulator.com/  
An online Turing machine simulator which allows the users to load their own input, as well as use a list of examples. Furthermore, the resource includes various tutorials and useful information on Turing machines. This work is relevant as it is an example of the kind of project I’d like to undertake in relation to Turing machines, whilst the information provided would be very useful in the development of my own project.

### Android Application Development
*My Fitness Pal, Albert Lee & Mike Lee*  
http://www.myfitnesspal.com/  
This is a smartphone app that allows users to track diet and exercise, allowing users to determine optimal caloric intake and nutrients for their goals. This work is relevant because it includes ideas that I would also like to work upon in the development of my own Android application.

### Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Inspiration
*Warren Lefevre*  
No online source (personal experience)  
My brother has just completed his third-year project in a computing related course in which he created a piece of machine learning related software, and has recommended to me that I consider undertaking a project within this field despite not having prior knowledge. This work is relevant as my brother could be of great help to me with the development of my own project in the same field.

## Initial Ideas
### Idea 1
**Context:** *Programming Language and Compiler Design*  
**Technique:** Compiler Theory and Design  
**Inspiration:** Pinecone and The Super Tiny Compiler  
Create my own programming language with a compiler to complement it. I will aim to make the language syntax as unique yet simple as possible, whilst also using the best features of multiple languages as inspiration to bring them all together. The aim will be to create a programming language which helps new developers understand the basics of programming. During development the project aim will initially be to implement basic features (e.g. variables, functions, etc), with more advanced features (e.g. classes) being kept for later.

### Idea 2
**Context:** *Turing Machine Model of Computation Software*  
**Technique:** Turing Machines  
**Inspiration:** Turing Machine Simulator  
Develop a Turing Machine model simulator which users can use to help understand Turing machines and how they work, as well as providing correct results with various input. Users will be able to test various machine configurations and be provided with explanations for each. The initial focus of development will be to create a Turing machine simulator which produces correct answers, followed by making it more adaptable with varying configurations.

### Idea 3
**Context:** *Android Application Development in Java*  
**Technique:** Advanced Programming  
**Inspiration:** My Fitness Pal  
Construct an Android application in Java using Android Studio where the focus will be on creating an application which allows users to manually enter and store calorie information of various foods and save the information to a database. Food can be combined into meals (with the accompanying information also being combined) and again saved. Further planned features would be providing exercise regimes based on the user’s goals, as well as more advanced methods of saving data (e.g. using the phone camera to scan nutrition information from packets and saving automatically).

### Idea 4
**Context:** *Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Software*  
**Technique:** Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence  
**Inspiration:** Brothers Third Year Project  
Make a piece of software capable of learning and adapting based on the information it receives. I am currently unsure what information and situations this software would be applicable to, but the general idea would be the same: to track data, demonstrating the patterns that emerge as well as adapting to perform its function more efficiently.
