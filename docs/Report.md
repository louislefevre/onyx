# Onyx Compiler

Your project report will contain about 12,000 - 15,000 words, not including the contents pages, abstract or appendices, and will contain at least the following sections:



## Abstract

Half a page or less mainly to help a librarian decide how to categorise your project.



## Acknowledgements

Acknowledge supporters.



## Contents

Every section, subsection, sub-sub section with the relevant page number



## Chapter 1 - Introduction

Chatty stuff about why you chose the project, why it's interesting, what you will learn etc. This chapter will end with brief a "road map" of the rest of the report. A road map very briefly summarises each chapter of the report: "Chapter 1 on page 17 introduces us to the ....Chapter 2 on page 33 discusses..." etc.



## Chapter 2 - Literature Review

Here you will show that you understand the problem and discuss how other people have attempted to solve the problem you are tackling. A good report will critically evaluate other people's work in the area you have chosen. This will be a more substantial chapter if the project is research-based rather than application-oriented.



## Chapter 3 - Requirements

Specification of what you set out to do. This may include test cases for the Testing and Evaluation stage.



## Chapter 4 - Design 

Design and Implementation of what you set out to do.



## Chapter 5 - Implementation

Discusses how the software was implemented and how the implementation follows the design presented in the previous chapter.



## Chapter 6 - Testing

Validation: does your system fulfil the original requirements?
Verification: does it function correctly according to the specification?



## Chapter 7 - Evaluation

Covers the evaluation of the product developed – i.e. what the user(s)/client think of the system, how it compares with other systems, how it matches the requirements, and so on.

Appraises the system developed with the original requirements and evaluates whether those requirements were appropriate.

Validation: does your system fulfil the original requirements?
Verification: does it function correctly according to the specification?



## Chapter 8 - Conclusions

Evaluates the project overall – how well it achieves its aims and objectives (outlined in the Introduction) and how it fits in and supports existing work in the field (covered in the Literature review).

Presents an evaluation of the project – it summarises what the project has achieved (what has been its contribution) and how the project has met its initial aims and objectives (and if not, it explains why). How does this project fit into and enhance existing work in the field? This chapter also covers a number of other issues. For example, was the development process model used appropriate (if not, why not and what else should have been used?)? Was the programming language suitable? What problems did you face and how did you overcome them? What would you do next if you had more time? If you were to do the project again, what would you do differently? What have you learnt and experienced from doing the project? How do you recommend the project should be taken forward in the future?

- How successful or unsuccessful was your work?
- How much of what you originally set out to achieve did you achieve?
- How did it compare to what others have done?
- How could it be extended if you had had more time?

These questions should be dealt with at a more general level than in the Testing and Evaluation chapters. It should be possible for a reader to get a reasonable idea of what you have done from reading the Introduction and Conclusion.
