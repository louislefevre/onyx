## Chapter 1 - Introduction
Onyx is a programming language designed to be used by beginners in attempt to simplify the foundations of writing code, allowing for a more straightforward learning experience. Coupled with the language is the Onyx Compiler, a written from scratch program that compiles source code written in unique Onyx syntax down into Java.

The primary goal of the project is to provide those who are learning programming for the first time with a tool specific to their needs. That is, a language that contains only the bare minimum amount of features required to learn basic coding skills, as to avoid overwhelming the user with unnecessary components. Whilst languages such as Python are often seen as a good starting language, they regularly require the user to deal with more complex functionality in order to simply set up the program. For example, handling imports, using a 'main' function, and understanding new file types. The large amount of features packaged with traditional languages makes everything infinitely more complex, and the scale of it can be overbearing for many. Onyx seeks to circumvent these issues and provide a language that plays to users familiarityâ€™s, adopting a start-and-go attitude where they can instantly begin writing syntax with no setup.

This report serves as a deeper explanation into the development of Onyx, providing insight into the inner workings of the program and the steps taken throughout its progression. Whilst this report will explain the more complex aspects of compilers and how they work in detail, it is assumed that the reader has a substantial level of knowledge with computers and in computer science as a whole.


## Chapter 3 - Requirements
Before planning the project, it needed to be decided what functionality the compiler would actually include. The original goal was to keep the language simple with only the bare minimum amount of features, typically those taught in introductory programming courses, so that precondition had to be kept in mind. After reviewing such courses and consulting with tutors, there were five main features to be included: variables, operators, conditionals, loops, and functions. These were perhaps the most common pieces of functionality taught to beginners in a learning environment, so it become vital that the compiler contained these components.

To compliment this it was required to include data types. Originally the goal was to only allow explicit variable declarations, where the user would have to define the type of a variable during declaration before it could be used. However, this idea was abandoned as providing the user with another thing to be concerned with was outside the boundaries of the projects goal of minimalism. Instead variables are implicit and do not need to be declared or given a type, only assigned. It would be possible for variables to be assigned values of different data types regardless of the type the previous value was, though it would not be possible to use contrasting data types with one another.

A greatly important feature was the addition of detailed error messages. One of the greatest pitfalls among novice programmers is their inability to read and understand error messages, often due to their verbose and jargon-filled nature. It is common among popular languages for error messages to be returned as a long and confusing mess, which while useful for experienced users, can be devastatingly difficult to decipher for learners. Its a goal of Onyx to instead provide the user with simple yet explanatory error messages; giving a clear indication for where the error occured, what caused it, and a possible explanation for how to fix it.

The compiler also removes a number of features typically built into languages, such as that of scope. All variables can be accessed globally, with no such thing as local variables. Whilst this would be an issue in a more large scale language, the simple nature of Onyx makes this viable whilst removing the need for the user to learn about scoping at this level. 


## Chapter 4 - Design
Designing of the project involved planning two areas: the layout and structure of the compiler code, and the syntax of the language.
