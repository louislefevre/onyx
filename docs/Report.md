## Abstract
The Onyx Compiler is a program designed with simplicity in mind, targetted towards learners and novices in the field of programming. Modern programming languages are not designed for educational purposes, and as such it can be an arduous task for beginners to start their journey when it comes to learning coding for the first time. This projects seeks to solve this problem by providing a language that contains only the most basic of functionality, simple syntax, insightful error messages, and an abundance of easy to understand documentation. The application was built with Java to allow for cross-platform compatibility, whilst also utilising JavaFX for development of the graphical user interface.

## Acknowledgements
A great deal of time and effort was required during the development of this project, which was only possible with the support and assistance of a number of people. I would like to begin by first thanking my supervisor, Dr Edward Anstead, who provided valuable support and guidance from the beginning. His experience, knowledge, and expertise contributed a great deal to the formation of the compiler, and yielded insight that brought the project to where it is today. I would also like to acknowledge the support provided by my parents throughout the years, as it is because of them that I have been given the opportunity to achieve so much and focus on my education. Finally, a special thank you goes to my girlfriend Atikah, who always recognised my hard work and encouraged me to be the best I can be. Without her support and love, I wouldn't be where I am today.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction <a name="1"></a>
Onyx is a programming language designed to be used by beginners in attempt to simplify the foundations of writing code, allowing for a more straightforward learning experience. Coupled with the language is the Onyx Compiler, a written from scratch program that compiles source code written in unique Onyx syntax down into Java.

The primary goal of the project is to provide those who are learning programming for the first time with a tool specific to their needs. That is, a language that contains only the bare minimum amount of features required to learn basic coding skills, as to avoid overwhelming the user with unnecessary components. Whilst languages such as Python are often seen as a good starting language, they regularly require the user to deal with more complex functionality in order to simply set up the program. For example, handling imports, using a 'main' function, and understanding new file types. The large amount of features packaged with traditional languages makes everything infinitely more complex, and the scale of it can be overbearing for many. Onyx seeks to circumvent these issues and provide a language that plays to users familiarityâ€™s, adopting a start-and-go attitude where they can instantly begin writing syntax with no setup.

This report serves as a deeper explanation into the development of Onyx, providing insight into the inner workings of the program and the steps taken throughout its progression. Whilst this report will explain the more complex aspects of compilers and how they work in detail, it is assumed that the reader has a substantial level of knowledge with computers and in computer science as a whole.

## Chapter 2 - Background Study <a name="2"></a>
The field of compilers is large and complex, with lots of different projects being developed for various purposes. However, it has become clear that despite this, there is a void to be filled which arguably appeals to every programmer thats ever existed.

### 2.1 The Problem <a name="2.1"></a>
The issue is that there are a lack of languages designed purely for learning, and therefore fail to keep beginners in mind. Whilst there are thousands of guides and tutorials dedicated to teaching those with no experience in the field, its become evident that there is seeminly an absense of languages built purely for the job.

There are a number of problems that present themselves exclusively with beginners, the main one being the lack of intelligible error messages. Many languages spit out a verbose string of jargon and numbers whenever an error occurs, which while useful to experienced programmers, are completely incoherent to the uninitiated. This is a distinct example of where a language has favoured complexity at the expense of simplicity, making it significantly more difficult to understand where a program went wrong. Its also worth noting that its rare for a language to even indicate to the user how to solve a problem clearly, and instead of telling them how to solve a problem it merely just states the problem itself, with the rest being up to the user to figure out. 

Though perhaps the greatest issue faced is syntax complexity. Whilst Python solves this issue for the most part, the majority of other languages arguably have complex syntax that is completely unintuitive. They aren't designed to be read as plain english, and as such it can be extremely difficult for newcomes to understand what a program is doing simply by reading over the source code. Also due to the scale and power of modern day compilers, there is myriad of keywords and in-built functions in the users hands. Whilst useful for developing large projects, the abundance of tools can be overwhelming for users and result in an information overload.

### 2.2 Existing Compilers <a name="2.2"></a>
It's no secret that there are an abundance of compilers and languages, so it would be infeasible to go through and review each one. Instead, it would be more productive to instead focus on languages commonly used by learners.

#### 2.2.1 Python <a name="2.2.1"></a>
The most popular language among beginners is Python due to its flexibility, simple syntax, and abundance of tutorials[20]. In terms of tackling the problems put forward, it perhaps does the best job out of the available options. It has intuitive and naturally readable syntax, an uncommon trait amongst modern languages, whilst also being rather easy to setup. However, its error messages tend to be verbose, confusing, and fail to provide a solution. It also contains a large amount of inbuilt tools and documentation, causing it to appear daunting at the mere sight of its complexity. Whilst currently being the best tool for the job, there is vast room for improvement as Python fails to tackle a large portion of these issues.

#### 2.2.2 JavaScript <a name="2.2.2"></a>
JavaScript is another common choice, particularly when it comes to web development, as a 2019 survey by StackOverflow found it to be the most popular language being used by developers[19]. It has relatively flexible and forgiving syntax compared to other object-oriented languages, whilst also being compatible with all major browsers[21]. However, it can be more difficult to setup and work with due to the fact its primarily used for front-end web development, which will also require the use of HTML/CSS. This means that users will also have to contend with learning those on top of JavaScript and having them work together, which adds an unessential extra layer of complexity. The error messages are again wordy and lack explanation, offering no insight for the inexperienced. Naturally, its clear that JavaScript fails to produce solutions for the presented problems.

#### 2.2.3 GitHub Projects <a name="2.2.3"></a>
The GitHub repository known as [Awesome Compilers](https://github.com/rsumner31/awesome-compilers) includes a list of compilers and interpreters composed by various users[18], making it useful to review a large selection of projects all at once. Based on the descriptions and features lists for the 36 repositories included, not a single one was designed to target an audience of beginners nor specifically solve the discussed issues.

### 2.3 Aims & Objectives <a name="2.3"></a>
The primary purpose of The Onyx Compiler is to fill the void caused by the lack of learning-based languages, and is designed solely with beginners in mind. The compiler is not meant to be complex, and is instead designed to be as simple as possible in order to teach the foundations of programming. Each of the problems previously discussed this project aims to solve, with the following detailing the main goals hoped to be achieved.

#### 2.3.1 Insightful Error Messages <a name="2.3.1"></a>
The compiler will provided detailed, easy to read error messages for the user. The information will be presented in plain English without the use of jargon, and give a clear indication as to where the error occurred using coloured markings, syntax returns, and line numbers. Coupled with this will be information that guides the user on how the issue may have come about, how it may be solved, and links to the appropriate Onyx documentation.

#### 2.3.2 Intuitive Syntax <a name="2.3.2"></a>
Syntax will be designed so it reads similarly to regular English, uses intuitive mathematical expressions, and reduces the amount of syntax required for certain expressions (e.g. dynamic  typing to remove the need to declare variable types). The objective is to make it at easy as possible for users to understand what each line of code is doing just by reading through the source code.

#### 2.3.3 Basic Functionality <a name="2.3.3"></a>
Given that the compiler is aimed solely at learners, the amount of functionality required is not great. The intention is to only focus on the basics, and so it will only include as much. These are the five main concepts that Onyx intends to teach its users about:
- Data types
- Variables
- Expressions/Statements
- Conditionals
- Loops
By only including the core components it reduces the amount of information users are presented with, preventing information overload and stopping them from feeling overwhelmed.

#### 2.3.4 Simple Setup <a name="2.3.4"></a>
A sad truth is that there are a portion of users, particularly non tech-savy ones, who get stuck on the setup and that alone can be enough to dissuade someone from continuing. That is why Onyx aims to make setup as easy as possible through the use of Java, as the JVM provides the opportunity for cross-compatibility amongst platforms to remove the need for using a specific operating system. Its even feasible that it could run on phones, reducing the technological requirement away from computers. Furthermore, Onyx will be capable of running from an executable file without any installation, only requiring the user to download the program to begin.

## Chapter 3 - Requirements <a name="3"></a>
Before planning the project, it needed to be decided what functionality the compiler would actually include. The original goal was to keep the language simple with only the bare minimum amount of features, typically those taught in introductory programming courses, so that precondition had to be kept in mind. After reviewing such courses and consulting with tutors, there were five main features to be included: variables, operators, conditionals, loops, and functions. These were perhaps the most common pieces of functionality taught to beginners in a learning environment, so it become vital that the compiler contained these components.

To compliment this it was required to include data types. Originally the goal was to only allow explicit variable declarations, where the user would have to define the type of a variable during declaration before it could be used. However, this idea was abandoned as providing the user with another thing to be concerned with was outside the boundaries of the projects goal of minimalism. Instead variables are implicit and do not need to be declared or given a type, only assigned. It would be possible for variables to be assigned values of different data types regardless of the type the previous value was, though it would not be possible to use contrasting data types with one another.

A greatly important feature was the addition of detailed error messages. One of the greatest pitfalls among novice programmers is their inability to read and understand error messages, often due to their verbose and jargon-filled nature. It is common among popular languages for error messages to be returned as a long and confusing mess, which while useful for experienced users, can be devastatingly difficult to decipher for learners. Its a goal of Onyx to instead provide the user with simple yet explanatory error messages; giving a clear indication for where the error occurred, what caused it, and a possible explanation for how to fix it.

The compiler also removes a number of features typically built into languages, such as that of scope. All variables can be accessed globally, with no such thing as local variables. Whilst this would be an issue in a more large scale language, the simple nature of Onyx makes this viable whilst removing the need for the user to learn about scoping at this level. 

## Chapter 4 - Design <a name="4"></a>
Designing of the project involved planning in three areas: the layout and structure of the compilers source code, the syntax of the language (also known as the language specification), and the graphical user interface (the GUI). Its important that each of these aspects were targetted individually, as it made objectives far clearer and removed the need for consistent revisions during development.

### 4.1 Compiler Design <a name="4.1"></a>
The goal of the compiler is to translate between the original syntax and Java, which means primarily focusing on front-end compiler construction. The middle-end and back-end portions are instead handled by Java, with such a design allowing the development of a language with unique syntax and functionality, without having to worry about the tricky implementation of close-to-machine-level aspects. A compiler goes through various stages when processing syntax, with each stage transforming the source programs representation in some way. In the form of a pipeline, each component takes input from its predecessor, transforms it, and feeds the output forward to the next component [1]. The amount of stages within a compiler can vary, but in the case of Onyx contains the following.

#### 4.1.1 Lexical Analysis <a name="4.1.1"></a>
Any compiler will always start with lexical analysis, which is performed by the lexer. It takes the source code as input and scans over it, typically left to right, and groups the characters into lexemes [1]. The lexer represents these lexemes in the form of tokens [2], with each token containing information about the type of data it holds. For example, given the input of an integer, the lexer would output a token that identifies the characters location in the text, its type (e.g. an integer token), and its value. This process is performed for all the characters in a given text, and the lexer outputs a stream of tokens [3]. During this phase, the lexer would also be responsible for reporting any invalid characters located in the source code.

The lexer was designed to be capable of handling all types of characters, whilst also taking into account their context. It had to be capable of consistently taking in new characters and identifying them correctly, whilst also adapting to deal with characters found within particular boundaries. For example, recognising that a number occurring after quotations is a part of a string, rather than a token in its own right. The handling of invalid characters must also be considered, as otherwise the lexer would become stuck and be unable to finish, and having a robust design means never failing to take in characters and output valid tokens.

In summary, the primary functions of this phase is to:
- Take a string of text as input.
- Inspect each individual character, classifying each token with its corresponding type, whilst also recognising invalid characters.
- Output a stream of tokens, often in the form of a list.
- Identify invalid characters.

##### Example
| Token       |     Token Type      |
| ----------- | :-----------------: |
| var         |     Identifier      |
| =           | Assignment operator |
| "my string" |       String        |
| +           |    Plus operator    |
| 10          |       Integer       |

#### 4.1.2 Syntax Analysis <a name="4.1.2"></a>
The second stage of compilation is syntax analysis, also known as parsing, and is performed by the parser. Its role is to take the list of tokens produced by the lexer as input, validate the arrangement of tokens against the programming languages grammatical rules, and from that generate a parse tree that represents the structure of the source program. The primary purpose of this component is to ensure the expressions made by the arrangement of tokens is syntactically correct, following a format defined by the language being used [2]. From this a parse tree can be generated, which demonstrates how each token is grouped together in each individual statement. The parser would also identify any syntactical errors found within the source code.

The parser is designed as a recursive descent parser, which adopts a top-down parsing strategy where it begins at the highest level of the parse tree and works its way down, building the parse tree as it goes [4]. The input is read from left to right, taking in tokens until it reaches the end of the file. Each token would be identified by its type, sending the parser flow in a different direction depending on the result. The following tokens would then be checked to ensure they appear as expected, such as an equals operator token appearing after an identifier token, and an expression would be returned. This expression would contain all its relevant tokens, such as in the case of the previous example: an identifier, an equals operator, and the assignment. In the original design the parser was only able to handle expressions, but this was later extended to also process statements so that full programs could be written all at once since the former only allowed REPL-like behaviour.

Another aspect that had to be considered is precedence for operators. Parsers sometimes define a priority value for each operator, and during parsing they are shuffled around with the parser being data driven by those priorities, providing an indicator for which expressions to parse next. This makes the adding of additional operators much easier, as it provides the ability to view operators and see their priority order.

In summary, the primary functions of this phase is to:
- Retrieve the tokens from the lexer.
- Checks if the source code is syntactically correct or not by comparing it against the grammatical rules of the programming language.
- Construct and output a parse tree representing the syntactic structure of the program.
- Identify invalid expressions and statements.

##### Example
```
(10 + 20) * 5

    *
   / \
  +   5
 / \  
10 20
```

#### 4.1.3 Semantic Analysis <a name="4.1.3"></a>
Next comes semantic analysis, which is another stage of parsing. Directly after syntax analysis, semantic analysis takes place as a means of gathering semantic information about the source code [5], with this phase being performed by the type checker in the case of Onyx. It receives the parse tree from the previous stage and adds extra information to it, such as: type checking to ensure type conversions are valid, and object binding for associating variable and function references with their definitions [6]. This is also where the symbol table is built; adding variables coupled with their values and types. An annotated parse tree is output as a result (annotated referring to the extra data having been added to the tree). It is during this phase that any errors relating to type incompatibility are identified.

Initially, it was designed so that semantic analysis would be performed within the parser alongside syntax analysis. It was soon found that this would be implausible since it typically requires a complete parse tree before being able to add annotations properly, so it was instead moved to the type checker as an individual component. The type checker functions by reviewing the type of expression or statement that is being executed and comparing the data types of each operand, as well as reviewing whether the operator being used is compatible. It contains a series of defined compatibility rules which must be adhered to, the prevailing rule of which is that only values of the same type can be used with one another. An error will be returned should there be an expression that fails to meet these rules. Any undeclared variables will also be identified during this stage, and be returned as errors.

In summary, the primary functions of this phase is to:
- Get the parse tree from the parser.
- Validate data type compatibility for operands and operators, ensure variables have been declared, and store variable information within the symbol table.
- Annotate the parse tree with data type information, producing an annotated parse tree.
- Identify mismatched data types, incompatible operands, and undeclared variables.

##### Example
```
x = 30
y = true
x * y
This will result in a type-mismatch error as integers and booleans are not compatible.
```

#### 4.1.4 Evaluation <a name="4.1.4"></a>
The final stage is the evaluation, performed by the aptly named evaluator. The purpose of this phase is to calculate the final outputs of each statement, revealing the final result. It reviews the annotated parse tree and with the extra information gathered by the type checker, is able to execute each expression in Java and return their values. The output is the final value of the statement being evaluated. Its also worth noting that this is where Onyx diverges when compared to other compilers, as they often instead follow semantic analysis with: intermediate code generation, code optimisation, and code generator. However, these stages are instead handled by Java and are not implemented by Onyx directly, and therefore will not be discussed here.

The design of the evaluator is opposite to the parser in regards to the fact that it works through the tree bottom-up; searching the tree by beginning at the furthest nodes, carrying their results up the tree as it works through to the larger expressions, using the newly found values to do so. The result returned is only ever stored either within another statement, or if its a top level statement within a variable. Any expressions that fails to store or use its result in one form or another is discarded. Also, a unique aspect of this stage is the fact no errors occur here, as all the necessary error identification should've happened in the prior stages. However, there are fail-safe exceptions thrown should an error slip through the cracks, as it helps catch out unhandled issues during development.

In summary, the primary functions of this phase is to:
- Obtain the annotated parse tree from the type checker.
- Evaluate each expression and statement.
- Return the resulting value(s).
- Identify any unhandled issues that have gone undetected during the previous stages.

##### Example
```
x = 30
y = 10
x * y
300
```

#### 4.1.5 Symbol Table <a name="4.1.5"></a>
The symbol table is a data structure that is maintained throughout every phase of a compilers life-cycle, responsible for storing the names of identifiers, as well as their respective values and data types [2]. It is also often used for scope management, but this is not present in Onyx due to the fact it only implements global variables.

The symbol table is designed to be implemented in the form of a hash map, with the name of the identifier as the key and the value and type as the value. Each of the previous stages has access to the symbol table, and are able to use it to check whether or not a symbol is contained within the table, as well as retrieve any information about a particular one. This is most prominent during the type checker and evaluator, as during these two stages is when types begin to become relevant for the reasons previously described.

In summary, the primary functions of this phase is to:
- Store the names of identifiers, along with their value and type.
- Provide a method for adding and removing symbols.
- Allow retrieval of information on symbols contained within the symbol table.

##### Example
```
x = 30
y = true

Symbol Table:
x = {
   name: "x",
   value: 5,
   type: integer
}
y = {
   name: "y",
   value: true,
   type: boolean
}
```

#### 4.1.6 Error Handling <a name="4.1.6"></a>
The error handler is responsible for handling errors before continuing with the compilation process, and like the symbol table is also accessible to every stage. Throughout each phase should an error occur, it is reported to the error handler and reported to the user in the form of an appropriately formatted error message. Errors are capable of occurring in every stage of the compiler with the exception of the evaluator, where only exceptions can occur.

In order to prevent interruption, Onyx is designed so that it may continue should an error occur. While this makes no difference in terms of the output (as only the error message is returned rather than any calculated result), it allows certain processes to continue being performed. For example during the generation of the parse tree, when an error occurs the invalid element is replaced by a placeholder (holding a null value), allowing the parse tree to still be built despite the invalid syntax. This means the compiler can still provide information regarding the tree for the rest of the syntax, as well as things like data types. By not having the compiler quit dead in its tracks during compilation it opens up the possibility to gather more information, as well as potentially provide tooling in the future.

In summary, the primary functions of this phase is to:
- Receive errors from each stage of compilation.
- Format those errors and generate a detailed message.
- Output the error message to the user.

##### Example
```
x = true
x * 10
Error (2, 2): Binary operator '*' is not defined for type 'boolean' and 'integer'.
	x * 10
```

### 4.2 Language Specification <a name="4.2"></a>
The language specification is what defines a programming language, detailing what valid syntax is and the behaviour comes from it. Onyx was designed with simplicity in mind, so the requirement for maintaining a simple specification was perhaps the most vital aspect during design. The main idea was to ensure each piece of functionality would be written and work as intuitively as possible, in order to leave little room for the user to be confused as to why something was working the way it was.

#### 4.2.1 Data Types <a name="4.2.1"></a>
Onyx was designed to use only the most basic and necessary data types. Languages such as Java include a large amount of variations for essentially what is the same data type, except with varying amounts of memory. For example, integers along with bytes, shorts, and longs. It was prudent to not consider these redundancies for use, due to the fact that their benefit of using less memory would not prove useful in the context of learning. Instead the compiler only contains the following types: integer, double, boolean, string. This allows the compiler to still provide all the necessary functionality typically found in most languages, except without the extra cruft that would do nothing except make learning more difficult.

Its worth noting that the compiler does not allow different data types to be used together. For example, an integer cannot be used with a double in any operations. The purpose of this is to help provide a clear distinction between data types and avoid unexpected results that are difficult to debug for novices, since type errors are not always obvious particularly when used with variables.

##### Example
```
a = 10     (integer)
b = 20.0   (double)
c = true   (boolean)
d = "text" (string)
```

#### 4.2.2 Variables <a name="4.2.2"></a>
In the original design it was thought that the language would be statically typed, requiring all variables to have their data types declared before use. This was later changed, however, so that the language was dynamically typed. The reason for this is that it made things far more simple from a user perspective, as variables could be reassigned at will without having to be concerned about the declared type, whilst also avoiding the worry of unexpected results due to the fact different types are incompatible with one enough when operated on. Not requiring users to declare variables before use was a good method of simplifying the language even further, since it removed the need to understand why declaring is necessary.

Variable scope in Onyx is also always kept global, no matter where a variable is declared. This design choice was primarily made due to the fact it removed the need for users to learn about scoping, and thus avoiding issues related to variables being out of bounds. In a much larger language this would of course be a major issue, but due to the fact programs written in Onyx will typically be very short in length and its purpose is simply to learn basic programming functionality, its not expected to cause problems.

##### Example
```
a = 10   (a is an integer)
b = true (a is now a boolean)
```

#### 4.2.3 Operators <a name="4.2.3"></a>
The compiler specifies use for all the standard mathematical operators you would typically require to write expressions, but also includes some extra ones such as modulo and power. These two were not going to be provided initially, but was later added since they could provide significantly more functionality without being too overbearing for the user. What was not implemented, however, was the use of increment and decrements operators. This is mainly due to the difference between having the unary operators as a prefix and post-fix, which changes the order in which a value is incremented and returned. Also it is not as intuitive to recognise for beginners unlike other operators, so its use would likely lead to confusion all round.

As a slight remedy for the lack of the previously mentioned, various assignment operators were specified instead. These would allow variables to use operators on themselves, providing a shorthand form to prevent users being required to write out the full expression that includes the identifier name. It was originally unclear whether this would be added at all since the same operation is still possible with the longhand form, but it was decided to be intuitive enough to keep in.

##### Example
```
a = 10
a = a + 15 (longhand form)
a += 15    (shorthand form using plus-assignment operator)

#### 4.2.4 Conditionals <a name="4.2.4"></a>
Conditional statements in Onyx are not too different from traditional languages and combines attributes from both Python and Java. For example, the specification doesn't require the use of parentheses for the condition but still allows them, giving the user the opportunity to use whichever they feel most comfortable with. However, a more imperative property is the presence of braces; they are required when declaring a block statement (code greater than 1 line), but can be avoided when encompassing only a single statement. In the former case the entire block will be executed, but in the latter only the next statement is executed. It was made a point that Onyx would not feature block statements that lack the use of braces, which is allowed in Python. The reason for this is that it can become very unclear which code belongs where, particularly when block groupings depend solely on indentation as in indicator. Whilst this is not an issue when only a single statement is involved, more than that can become confusing for users and thus has been disallowed entirely.

Another notable design feature is the enforcement of Allman style indentation, which means open braces must begin on a new line and the use of single-line conditional statements is disallowed. This is intended to encourage the use of writing clearer, more modular code, whilst also providing the additional benefit of having all code written in Onyx look the same, allowing for easier reviewing of other users work.

##### Example
```
a = 0

if 1 < 2
    a = 10
else
    a = 20

if a < 20
{
    a = 30
    a *= 5
}
```

#### 4.2.5 Loops <a name="4.2.5"></a>
Loops are designed with intuition in mind, and attempts to adopt Pythons style of looping by having the syntax read more as a sentence. The purpose is to have loops be clearer in their functionality just by reading the syntax, unlike in Java where its not easily understandable to the untrained eye how loops are working without a detailed explanation. Many of the other properties of loops are the same as conditionals, such as the enforcement of Allman style indentation and the use of braces in block statements, the reasons for which were explained in the previous section. Though a feat unique to Onyx loops is the inclusion of the upper bound value, which is uncommon in traditional language specifications. When looping it is often the case that the final upper bound value is not executed in the loops body, which is one of the more unintuitive aspects of programming. However, the compiler remedies this by always including the upper value in the execution of the code.

##### Example
```
var = 0

loop i from 1 to 10
{
    var += i
    var *= 2
}
```

### 4.3 Graphical User Interface <a name="4.3"></a>
The GUI was designed with minimalism in mind as it had to be clear how to use immediately on first use, whilst also not being too daunting for beginners. The main tools needed for regular use also had to be in clear sight all the time, whilst extra functionality would be somewhat hidden out the way until required. Essentially, a sort of abstraction was kept in mind during its planning.

#### 4.3.1 Integrated Development Environment <a name="4.3.1"></a>
The main portion of the GUI would be the IDE, which houses the main components for entering code, running the program, and examining the output. Aside from a menu, these three things are the only elements found within the main interface. The purpose of this is to keep it simple, with only the most necessary components found in plain sight. As previously mentioned the design will also include a menu bar at the top of the IDE, which will be responsible for housing an array of extra functionality. Some of this extra functionality included in the menu bar is file management (e.g. opening and saving files), links for help documentation, and opening the REPL (discussed in the next section). The IDE also has its own syntax highlighting, designed with complimentary colours in mind that make it easy to distinguish between syntax and their associated functionality.

#### 4.3.2 Read Evaluate Print Loop <a name="4.3.2"></a>
An extra feature that comes with the IDE is the REPL; a simple program that reads input one line at a time and returns a result. It contains a system for tracking variables, including information about their type, value, and name. The purpose is to provide a simplier, more visual method for understanding the basics of writing mathematical expressions and declaring variables. It essentially acts a dumbed-down version of the compiler and is provided for learners who are struggling to take in entire programs at once, since instead it gives them the opportunity to do things one line of code at a time. Its also worth noting that the REPL doesn't include the use of conditionals or loops, as it is intended for single-line statements rather than multiline ones.

## Chapter 5 - Implementation <a name="5"></a>
The implementation portion of the project involved completing both a compiler and a GUI individually, the details for which is discussed in the following sections.

### 5.1 Compiler Implementation <a name="5.1"></a>
Implementation of the compiler meant following the design from the previous chapter and finding a way to apply it in Java. It has been built in a way where the components are as modular as possible, with each stage feeding into the next. This structure made it rather trivial to isolate each aspect and then implement the functionality individually, so exploring the source code isn't too challenging.

#### 5.1.1 Lexer <a name="5.1.1"></a>


#### 5.1.2 Parser <a name="5.1.2"></a>


#### 5.1.3 Type Checker <a name="5.1.3"></a>


#### 5.1.4 Evaluator <a name="5.1.4"></a>


#### 5.1.5 Symbol Table <a name="5.1.5"></a>


#### 5.1.6 Error Handler <a name="5.1.6"></a>


### 5.2 Graphical User Interface <a name="5.2"></a>
The GUI has also been built entirely separate from the compiler, with the only link between them being the user input and the resulting output. Whilst technically being implemented in Java, the GUI was made using JavaFX - a software platform for creating desktop applications. This was further assisted through the use of the JavaFX tool Scene Builder that provides a visual layout for designing user interfaces without the need for coding, instead creating the interface with FXML, which is a XML format used specifically for designing JavaFX GUIs.

The original draft of the IDE was developed using solely JavaFX and only contained a handful of features: a menu bar, code area, and output terminal. Whilst it worked in regards to its most basic purpose of running code and producing an output, it was buggy and easy to break when attempting to manipulate the interface in any way. As a result it was completely overhauled and rebuilt using Scene Builder, which provided the opportunity to fill in all the gaps that were originally missed.

#### 5.2.1 Visual Layout <a name="5.2.1"></a>
The first stage was to focus on designing the interface itself; figuring out what functionality would be included, where it would go and how it would look. This was rather trivial as Scene Builders drag-and-drop functionality, coupled with FXMLs simplicity, made it extremely easy to change things and view the results instantly. During this it was imperative that the interface was adaptable and wouldn't break when manipulated, as was the problem with the first draft. Fortunately there were options menus available built to avoid this where each individual aspect could be told to adapts its size if needed, allowing the entire GUI to fit into a given space.

#### 5.2.2 Controllers <a name="5.2.2"></a>
Next was implementing the functionality for interactions with the interface, such as when a button is pressed or code is typed. To manage this FXML uses a 'controller' - a class it utilises for initialising and managing the GUIs elements. Within this class all the methods to be run are stored, and are called upon by FXML when their corresponding component is interacted with. Once this link is made between the GUI and the controller, the rest of the implementation is plain Java code (with the exception of outputting information back to the interface, for which components have their own functionality to do so).

#### 5.2.3 File Manager <a name="5.2.3"></a>
File management is handled by the 'FileManager' class, providing methods for opening and saving files. The main consideration taken here was exception handling - a lot can go wrong if a user opens an invalid file, doesn't select a file, or a file changes midway through handling. To deal with this each method returns an extensive amount of exceptions, each ones purpose being to identify what went wrong. For example, an invalid file extension error (IllegalArgumentException) is handled differently to a file not being selected (NullPointerException). This extra information gives implementing classes the opportunity to handle individual errors it in the proper way, and avoid unexpected results if something goes wrong.

For opening and saving files most of the heavy lifting is performed by the 'FileChooser'; a JavaFX class that provides a dialog window for selecting files and directories. Returned from this is a 'File' object pointing to the users choice, which is then checked for validation. In the case of opening a file, it is checked to see if it is null (a result of not selecting a file), cannot be found (the file has been moved or deleted since being selected), has incorrect permissions (the user doesn't have read access to the file), or uses an invalid extension (the user selected a file type outside of the ones specified). If none of these are true, the file is read and its contents returned. For saving as the process is identical except for checking that the user has write access instead, otherwise the contents of the code area are written to the file. The save method is used for quick saving a work in progress file, but is first checked to make sure that it hasn't changed in any way (moved, renamed, deleted). If it hasn't the contents are instantly written, and if not it defaults back to the save as functionality.

The file manager also keeps a track of the current file being worked on and its contents using the variables 'currentFile' and 'originalText', each of which are updated every time the user reads or writes to a file. The former is used to validate that a file hasn't changed since its last modification, and is used by the 'saveFile' function to decide whether to save a file immediately, or force the user to create a new file. The latter is used to track if the original text (from the last accessed file) is different from the text currently in the code area through use of the 'checkIfSaved' method, providing the opportunity to alert the user that they have unsaved work if they attempt to perform certain actions (e.g. opening a different file or closing the application).

## Chapter 6 - Testing <a name="6"></a>
To test that Onyx successfully meets the requirements and specifications originally set, the independent procedures of verification and validation were used as a means of quality assurance.

### 6.1 Validation <a name="6.1"></a>
"Validation. The assurance that a product, service, or system meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders. It often involves acceptance and suitability with external customers. Contrast with verification." - Project Management Body of Knowledge [7]

The objective of this procedure is to discover whether or not the compiler is successfully able to meet the needs and requirements previously defined, in order to prove itself as a useful product amongst its stakeholders.

### 6.1.1 User Testing <a name="6.1.1"></a>
There are two primary stakeholders to be considered for the Onyx compiler: the users and the clients. An example of a potential client would be a business that deals in personalised tutoring for prospective programmers, with the users being their students. At the time of writing it is currently difficult for user testing to take place due to the fact the country is currently experiencing a lock-down due to the ensuing pandemic. As a result, gathering people for testing has proved difficult and resulted in a limited sample. However, despite not being able to test users directly it has been possible to get in touch with Atikah, a coding tutor who works for the computer training school Spark4Kids and has experience in helping young children to learn basic programming skills.

**Question 1: How do you feel about the scope of the compiler? Does it have too many or too little features for its intended purpose?**  
Atikah explained that she felt the scope of the compiler was just right; it covered all the basics without going into too much of the more complex features, which she often found were confusing for beginners to deal with. By keeping it limited it made it easier to focus on each individual aspect and create clearer goals in terms of learning. 

**Question 2: Do you think that the insightful error messages will be useful for students in helping them figure out problems for themselves?**  
She explained that in her experience, students of a young age struggle to make much sense of error messages and often will simply ask for help rather than attempt to understand the meaning. This is mostly due to the verbose and confusing nature of the error messages, but also because they are younger in age and more unable or unwilling to figure out the problem for themselves. As a result, despite the clearer error messages they may still not make use of them. However, she did explain that it would still be useful as it would make it easier for tutors to figure out the problem themselves and explain it to the student. It was also noted that older students wouldn't have this issue and would be more capable of understanding the error messages themselves.

**Question 3: Do you feel that the compiler would be a useful tool for students learning programming for the first time?**  
Due to the well-defined scope of functionality and insightful error messages, Atikah agreed that it would prove as a valuable learning tool for novice programmers. Most modern languages aren't designed for learning and come with a lot of extra functionality that can be confusing for beginners to get around, so having a language designed with learners in mind would make things far easier from a teaching standpoint. 

### 6.2 Verification <a name="6.2"></a>
"Verification. The evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or system complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. It is often an internal process. Contrast with validation." - Project Management Body of Knowledge [7]

The objective of this procedure is to discover whether or not the compiler successfully meets the requirements set in terms of functionality, design and quality, demonstrating that its goals have been met and is capable of performing to a high standard. To help achieve this objective unit tests have been developed for the major components of the compilers pipeline, each one using specialised inputs that help identify errors specific to section being tested. The following explains the testing that took place, and identifies how it ensures requirements have been met.

#### 6.2.1 Lexer Testing <a name="6.2.1"></a>
In the original design of the lexer its primary requirement was to be capable of taking a string as input, inspecting each character and categorising it into a token with the corresponding type, and then outputting a list of tokens. Since all of the tests assess by default the input of strings and output of tokens, the main focus becomes the categorising of tokens. This was rather trivial as it simply required the input of single character or word, and then examining the type of the single token found within the returned list, seeing if it matched what was expected. This was repeated for every character that was defined within the language, and the tests passing successfully meant that they were all being identified correctly.

#### 6.2.2 Parser Testing <a name="6.2.2"></a>
The parsers function is to check if the source code is syntactically correct by comparing it against the grammatical rules of the language. Given the large amount of possibilities in terms of combinations of tokens, the first step was to break down the tests into different expression categories: literal, unary, binary, identifier, assignment, and parenthesised expressions. Each one would be responsible for implementing tests for its assigned expression type, making it easy to discover which expression failed and the location the issue occurred in the parser. The tests would simply run the input through the parser and examine the type of expression that was returned, and check that it matched against the expected outcome.

In order to expand these test cases they were also used in conjunction with one another, for example all the tests were wrapped in parentheses and then passed as parenthesised expressions, allowing the amount of inputs to expand massively without the need to manually add extra cases. This was rather vital to include, as otherwise it would have meant either a lot of boilerplate code or lack of edge case testing. In any case, the passing of the tests provided clarity in the fact that the parser would correctly verify the syntactic precision of the source code.

#### 6.2.3 Type Checker Testing <a name="6.2.3"></a>
Validating the type checker was rather similar to the parser in terms of how it was implemented, as not much changes outside of data types. Again each test was compartmentalised into various categories, with the result being compared against the expected expression type. Though since the role of the type checker is to validate type compatibility between operands and operators, the successful return of the correct expression type meant that type validation was achieved and its function was performed correctly.

#### 6.2.4 Evaluator Testing <a name="6.2.4"></a>
The evaluators main job is to evaluate each expression and statement, returning the resulting values. This was particularly simple to test since it only required surveying the final result. Each unit test would take expressions of a particular type, same as previously, and evaluate the results by running them through the evaluator. The values returned were then compared against the expected outcome, and if they matched the tests passed. It was again rather imperative that this stage used a large pool of inputs for testing, as the amount of possibilities is extremely large and would potentially reveal a significant number of edge case issues.

#### 6.2.5 Error Handler Testing <a name="6.2.5"></a>
The final stage of unit testing takes place within the error handler, whose primary responsibility is to receive errors and output them to the user. Up until this point the unit tests have focused on correct inputs rather than incorrect ones, so this is where invalid syntax is purposely passed to see if the expected error message is returned. This was broken down into three categories: lexical errors occurring in the lexer, syntax errors occurring in the parser, and semantic errors occurring in the type checker. If the broken syntax resulted in the expected error occurring, it can be verified that the compiler successfully handles errors should they transpire.
